    "In the final assignment for this course, you will be using one of three different analysis methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Option A: Use transaction data for mining associations rules\n",
    "* Option B: Use clustering on an unlabeled dataset to provide insight or features\n",
    "* Option C: Use collaborative filtering to build a custom recommendation system\n",
    "\n",
    "Your choice of dataset will largely determine the task that you are trying to achieve. Though the dataset does not need to change from your previous tasks. For example, you might choose to use clustering on your data as a preprocessing step that extracts different features. Then you can use those features to build a classifier and analyze its performance in terms of accuracy (precision, recall) and speed. Alternatively, you might choose a completely different dataset and perform rule mining or build a recommendation system.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "Dataset Selection and Toolkits\n",
    "---\n",
    "As before, you need to choose a dataset that is not small. It might be massive in terms of the number of attributes (or transactions), classes (or items, users, etc.) or whatever is appropriate for the task you are performing. Note that scikit-learn can be used for clustering analysis, but not for Association Rule Mining (you should use R) or collaborative filtering (you should use graphlab-create from Dato). Both can be run using iPython notebooks as perfomed in class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a report covering in detail all the steps of the project. The results need to be reproducible using only this report. Describe all assumptions you make and include all code you use in the iPython notebook or as supplemental functions. Follow the CRISP-DM framework in your analysis (you are performing all of the CRISP-DM outline). This report is worth 20% of the final grade.\n",

    "Regarding how an analysis of this data set may be used in the real-world, one of the most beneficial uses of the resulting system would be for movie streaming services like Netflix. Netflix is constantly adding new movies to their offering that they believe will be in high demand. At the same time, they are constantly removing under-performing titles. They do this in order to maximize the revenue generated from each title after paying licensing fees, to make sure their offering remains current and relevant, and they also do this to ensure that users of the service are happy with what they are paying for. \n",
