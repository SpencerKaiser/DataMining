    "You are to build upon the predictive analysis (classification) that you already completed in assignment two, adding additional modeling from new classification algorithms. You should use appropriate cross validation for all of your analysis (you should exlpain your chosen method of validation). Try to use as much testing data as possible in a realistic manner (you should define what you think is realistic and why). Follow the CRISP-DM framework in your analysis (you are not performing all of the CRISP-DM outline, only the portions relevant to the grading rubric outlined below). This report is worth 20% of the final grade. You may complete this assignment in teams of as many as three people (but no more). Only turn in one report to blackboard. \n",

    "Write a report covering all the steps of the project. The results should be reproducible using your report. Please carefully describe every assumption and every step in your report.\n",

    "Dataset Selection\n",
    "---\n",
    "Select a dataset identically to the way you selected for assignment one. You are not required to use the same dataset that you used for assignment one or assignment two, but you are encouraged. You must identify two or more classification OR regression tasks from the dataset. For example, if your dataset was from the diabetes data you might try to predict two tasks: (1) if a patient will be readmitted within a 30 day period or not, and (2) what the total number of days a patient will spend in the hospital, given their history and specifics of the encounter. \n",

    "1. Predict if a person makes **more than $50,000 dollars a year**, based on their age, race, sex, etc. (all of the attributes)\n",

After advertisements have reached their targets, data should be recorded as to whether or not the individual purchased the product or service.
