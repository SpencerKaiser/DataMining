I've spent a good chunk of time reading through each of the parameters for DecisionTreeClassifier (criterion, splitter, max_depth, min_samples_split, min_samples_leaf, max_features, random_state, min_density, compute_importances, max_leaf_nodes), but none are jumping out at me. The best way to prevent overlearning that I can think of is to pass only a subset of the dataset to the function to test upon. Other than that, I think you could probably tweak the max_depth or max_features attributes to modify how 'perfect' the fitting becomes, but I'm not sure. I need a little more practice with this stuff to really understand the intricacies of what is going on!"
