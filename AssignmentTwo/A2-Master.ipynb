      "You are to perform predictive analysis (classification) upon a data set: model the dataset using methods we have discussed in class: logistic regression and support vector machines, and making conclusions from the analysis. Follow the CRISP-DM framework in your analysis (you are not performing all of the CRISP-DM outline, only the portions relevant to the grading rubric outlined below). This report is worth 15% of the final grade. You may complete this assignment in teams of as many as three people (but no more). Only turn in one report to blackboard. \n",

      "Select a dataset identically to the way you selected for assignment one. You are not required to use the same dataset that you used for assignment one, but you are encouraged. You must identify two or more classification tasks from the dataset. For example, if your dataset was from the diabetes data you might try to predict two tasks: (1) if a patient will be readmitted within a 30 day period or not, and (2) what the total number of days a patient will spend in the hospital, given their history and specifics of the encounter. \n",
